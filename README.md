# Responsive Web-Design <br>
`Creator: Zerek Cover`<br>

This site serves as a demo, and learning "playground" to experiment with creating web pages and apps that behave in ways that appear "normal" to the user, when changing screen sizes.

Use either Flexbox OR Grid formatting to recreate your lab-01 responsive site. Your site at this point should show a specific display for a mobile view, and a desktop view. After reformatting using your desired responsive style (flex/grid), add a third view to your site, that will be seen when using a tablet view (768x1024 or 1024x768, try both as a stretch-goal!)
